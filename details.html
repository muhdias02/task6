                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>The apex of power - the Poco F4 GT steps on the scene with no shortage of boldness in its tagline. It's not unfounded - the latest chipset and super-fast charging do project an image of power, 
                    but there's also a playful side to it - you get shoulder triggers for in-game action, as well as a quad-driver speaker setup for richer tunes.
                </p>
                <h1>Poco F4 GT Unboxing</h1>
                <p>The F4 GT ships in a two-piece cardboard box that's the usual Poco mix of yellow and black.
                    The black is not a solid color now, though - it has an added touch of a fine carbon fiber pattern
                    So while there's no 'gaming' in the name, there's a hint of the aesthetic.
                    Some extra effort has gone into the accessories, too. The cable for that 120W HyperCharge adapter has a fancy L-shaped plug encased in aluminum - pretty nice out of context, but also functional.
                </p>
                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p>Poco may have opted out of the Gaming moniker for the F4 GT, as they did with the F3 GT, but they've kept the styling of the alter ego - down to some... questionable details that we'll get to in a bit.
                    The essence is solid, no complaints there - a sculpted aluminum frame holds together two sheets of glass.
